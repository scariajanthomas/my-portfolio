        Hi, I’m <span className="text-white font-semibold">Jan Thomas</span>.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        I don’t just test software — I observe it. I question patterns, challenge assumptions, and dig deeper when things don’t make sense.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Like the lone wolf or the silent raven, I prefer depth over noise, clarity over chaos.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        With experience in Quality Engineering, I bring calm precision to testing — from Android platforms to AI-based web tools. Python and automation are my current tools, and I’m continuously evolving.
      </p>

      <p>
        Always seeking. Always learning.<br />
        Ready to protect quality — quietly but effectively.
